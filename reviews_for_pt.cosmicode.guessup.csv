pt.cosmicode.guessup,Luis Beauperthuy,"I just paid and it's been 30 minutes and nothing, I don't have the extra categories, I've done everything, close the app, reset the phone a nothing, the only thing they are fast is taking your money because they charge it",1
pt.cosmicode.guessup,Aaron,"My kids LOVE this game. I first played it in a bar with friends and brought it home for the kids. Its a great game, lots of options, great for social experiences, helps with english practice. I purchased the kid version years ago and I just purchased a pack on this version and had some issues but customer service was quick to respond and helpful. Highly recommend. If you dont see your purchase and you had the game a long time, try uninstall and reinstall before restoring purchase, worked for me.",5
pt.cosmicode.guessup,Melany Martinez,"This is so amazing, I love how there is barely any ads, my family love playing this game all together its definitely the best charades game we've ever played.",5
pt.cosmicode.guessup,Naor,"paid $6 for decks and it still shows obnoxious video ads between rounds. I'd recommend you pass on this app, as the developers are clearly only interested in monetization. Reply to developer: you 100% have control over your app and whether it displays ad for paying customers lol üòÇ in fact, you sell ANOTHER upgrade to remove ads for yet another $5.99. How greedy can you get? Reply 2: cool. Yes. Greedy. Can I have a refund so I can uninstall your app?",1
pt.cosmicode.guessup,Dallas Nelson,Purchased the adult themed pack for $5. It will not download. I go to buy again and it says I own the packs and purchases are restored but they are unavailable .,1
pt.cosmicode.guessup,Katsuki Bakugou,Awesome App! Great to Play in Lines at Canadas Wonderland to Pass the Time! Great and Fun!,5
pt.cosmicode.guessup,Lara Rode,"10x better than the HeadsUp app!! Awesome + affordable deck selection, and love that there are options for how long each round is! The only thing I've noticed is you can sometimes get repeats very quickly if you play a deck twice in a row, would be nice if there was some caching to save which cards you have seen in a session so you don't get repeats right in a row.",5
pt.cosmicode.guessup,Harmoni T,"Me and my mom love this game, but can you please fix the Correct is down and pass is up. We are Confused. Anyway, this game is awesome! Keep up the good work!",4
pt.cosmicode.guessup,Winnifred Wolfe,"While it is a fun and decent game, the timer is ridiculous. I hate that it pauses after each answer. Because of this, seconds are taken away from the timer because it doesn't stop it perfectly. When there is 5 seconds left, even if the timer is stopped, the game still ends in 5 seconds.",3
pt.cosmicode.guessup,A Google user,"Great app, amazing graphic designs, various optional customs, no annoying ads, you can play it anywhere you want because it does not require a Wi-Fi connexion, and I always have so much fun playing this with friends or family because there's no winner or loser (at least in the way that we play), we just enjoy it together. I highly recommend this game üòâ",5
pt.cosmicode.guessup,A Google user,"My favorite charades app is the one by Fat Chicken Studios but I realised it's no longer on the Google Play Store. Luckily I still have it on my phone. It has been my staple party game for the past 2 years. Then I came across this new app. The UI is nicer and the categories look more fun. Only issue is that the font for individual words during gameplay is too small. I've manually set dpi to 598, but it wasn't a problem for the other Charades app. This is holding me back from paying to remove ads",4
pt.cosmicode.guessup,David Dobbs,Had to uninstall immediately. lots of variety easily navigated. just wouldn't skip or correct when tilting screen or with buttons. Meaning stuck on one word constantly. A shame looks like it could be great fun,1
pt.cosmicode.guessup,Myth,Fun family game to play with friends and family!,5
pt.cosmicode.guessup,Viet Anh ‚ÄúZenerik‚Äù Le,Bought the premium subscription but the game never unlock access to the content for me eventhough order had been paid. Attempting to restore purchase is stuck at loading for hours (that I've tried to no avail). Cannot even 'Give feedback' in app as it's stuck at 'Sending'. Otherwise the ad is way too aggressive for such a short play session. Cannot recommend.,1
pt.cosmicode.guessup,Sinead Brown,"Played this and it wasn't what I thought and I thought good of it it doesn't work for me I go into the game and I either get knocked out or a blank screen and when I do I get limited iteams to guess, please fix this I don't know if its a bug but my phone can open other apps perfectly.",2
pt.cosmicode.guessup,Frank Patak,some hard things to guess for my kiddo but over all it is a fun little game for you family and friends.,4
pt.cosmicode.guessup,Bee,"The app worked fine, but they made it extremely difficult to unsubscribe. Even after I unsubscribed, they continued to charge me. I had to eventually go through Google for the unsubscription to go through. This is sheer greed and unacceptable. Will never use this product again.",1
pt.cosmicode.guessup,Fransiska N,"Hi, updating the app solved the tapping issue. However, my purchases are still not showing up. I've chosen restore purchases and waited for a minute or so, but it just kept loading. When I tried to purchase them again, it would said I've bought it.",4
pt.cosmicode.guessup,nikhar asad,"Had a lot of fun playing, except the video feature didn't work. Was looking forward to it üôÅ",3
pt.cosmicode.guessup,A Google user,"Even though this game can be fun for 3 or more people, it's just a copy of the game Heads Up!, except with 1 game mode. It also gets a bit hard with only 2 players (one acting out, the other holding the phone). Other than that, the game is kid friendly and can be used for family game night.",3
pt.cosmicode.guessup,Annie Randhawa,Cant with the ads,2
pt.cosmicode.guessup,bella,Downloaded this game on a chance and it was SO MUCH FUN! It had a whole group of us (older and younger) belly laughing! Our favourite categories were sounds and objects. The only thing is that the video (of other players) would work even when camera permissions were allowed.,4
pt.cosmicode.guessup,Chenifa Tankwi,I don't like that there isn't any option to change the language into Dutch. Now I can't play with my younger siblings because their English is not that goodüòí.,3
pt.cosmicode.guessup,Jenica Wilcox,Lots of ads and interruptions even when you've paid for content,1

pt.cosmicode.guessup,L Y,Really good app. only froze once but my kids enjoyed it.,5
pt.cosmicode.guessup,Lesego Seiphoro,It is nice and has nice questions Problem you have to purchase some other box's,3
pt.cosmicode.guessup,A Google user,So the game keeps on stopping for some reason and its soo annoying and also for a tablet like Im using its not like a celphone. When I use my phone I have to turn my phone up for pass and down for correct but if I use my tablet I have to click left for pass and right for correct.Soo umm its still pretty good to play but this mite happen to you to soo be carful ok.,4
pt.cosmicode.guessup,A Google user,Downloaded specifically for the create your own mode (Wanted to make one for The Office lol) but it's really annoying that I can't scroll down to see all the words I added in. I can see about 3 rows worth of words but after that I can't see any new ones,3
pt.cosmicode.guessup,Arianna Cavagnoli,"Cute and funny but certain translations (in Italian) need to be fixed. Either they're the literal translation, that don't make sense, or they're left in other languages.",3
pt.cosmicode.guessup,Yasmine Ali,"Are you kidding me? THE BEST HEADS UP GAME EVER, I love it, 1000x better than charades or heads up but one problem.. there are not so many topics or options I already finished all and don't have something new, the new ones are with money and it is a risk for what could happen after you pay and would be a waste of money please add more topics or options Thank youüòò Please reply back",5

pt.cosmicode.guessup,Lesego Shopane,Me and my classmates absolutely love this game even apart that you have to pay for other decks. But it is a good quality and fun game.,5
pt.cosmicode.guessup,A Google user,"5 stars for the game, but for this recent update, the game keeps restarting! Likely because of the Google Play account since it works fine on my previous phone, but keeps crashing on my new phone after connecting to Google Play. Please fix this!",5
pt.cosmicode.guessup,Joe Gulley,"Way better than heads up, but occasionally freezes for a few seconds, repeats a lot, and the team score didn't properly show the winner",3
pt.cosmicode.guessup,A Google user,I went from 135 coins to 100 coins without spending any of them...I was enjoying the game but if it can steal coins randomly then there is something wrong...please customer support contact me to resolve issue Also it asked me to log in through gmail i connected and now it won't anymore,1

pt.cosmicode.guessup,A Google user,"I'm sorry, this is just really boring, answers that are wrong are still correct, I was on Christmas and it was asking if cupid was related, I accidently pressed yes and it said it was correct, please work on this, its really annoying, and please let me know when you have fixed it, Then I'll redownload it and most likely give it 5 stars, thanks for reading this.",1
pt.cosmicode.guessup,A Google user,The game is extraordinarly enjoyable! There are so many categories to choose from and it is super fun to play! The fact that you can make your own category is just mind blowing!,5
