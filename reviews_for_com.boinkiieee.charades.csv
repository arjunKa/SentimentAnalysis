com.boinkiieee.charades,Jacqueline Rosario,"The game is great. Really easy to navigate and it has a guide at the initial start up of the app. Tons of categories that I've never seen in any other charades app so that's awesome, plus they're all completely free. You can also make custom categories and can play with custom game modes. There's so much variety and options! Fun for family and friends.",5
