com.wb.headsup,Nick B,The game is amazing HOWEVER the home page is terrible!! It used to be good. I own every expansion (100+) but there is just a single line that only allows you to see 3 at a time!?! Why?? You used to be able to see way more. This makes finding what one you want to play almost impossible especially if you just want to scroll through them. Will change rating to 5 stars once this is fixed.,2
com.wb.headsup,Michael Bauman,"The newest patches make the game very responsive and playable again. But I can only give 4 stars based on the terrible interface used to select a deck. There are no categories for sorting the decks, no grid system to look at the decks, just a massively long single scroll wheel, while an advert takes up 75% of the screen. That's just not acceptable in this age of apps. The interface punishes the people who paid more money, by increasing the time spent finding a deck and loading the game.",4
com.wb.headsup,Amy Anderson,"I can't get the app to start. It just sits on the Heads Up screen with the loading ring filled in about 1/8 of the way. To add to the frustration, every once in awhile after it tries to load for several minutes without any progress, a message will pop up saying that it needs internet to work. This happens when my Wi-Fi is at full strength. This app cost me a fortune and is unusable. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, nothing gets it to work. Please fix it!!",1
com.wb.headsup,Dawneisha Hill,"I had the game on my phone for almost 2 years. It was awesome when first downloaded... BUT It has not been working since Fall 2019. At first, it would freeze or close out, now it does not go past the loading screen. I uninstalled it and reinstalled it. It loads like it going start then completely closes when reaches 100%. I'm uninstalling the app. It's worthless.",1
com.wb.headsup,Tikka Kids,"Played this on a friend's iPhone and was a lot of fun. got it on my Android and the first few times I opened it, it slowly loaded the wheel, and as soon as it loaded, it would kick me out. I was about to delete it when I tried again and it worked. Everything was EXTREMELY slow, and I never even got to try a deck it was freezing and lagging so much. I shut off my phone and turned it back on, and it made my entire phone slow if it was open, even if I wasn't playing it. Fun game if/when it works.",1
com.wb.headsup,A Google user,"This is a great game, especially for groups of 5 or 6. The only problem is the controls. The game uses gyro controls as inputs, and they DON'T WORK. If two big buttons were added, one for correct and one for pass, it would be SO much easier. The terrible controls are the only thing keeping me from leaving a five star review. Please, just add buttons!",3
com.wb.headsup,A Google user,the game is fine even though they've taken a very old concept for a game and made it seem like they completely reinvented it themselves. The main problem with the game is it they want you to complete a set of multiple things back to back though their voice recognition is trash. additionally they activate video replay for every minute that you're playing. So if you wanted to you could rewind to whoever is trying to give you clues about the names and watch them over and over again. but the biggest gripe I have is the fact that if you're trying to actually play the game correctly seldom does it actually recognize your voice and contribute that as an actual answer. you're best off finding a list of a hundred and printing them off and then cutting them into little bits and then guessing them from there. This game needs a lot of work.,1
com.wb.headsup,A Google user,"What happened? I have has the game on other phones and it worked without issues. Now, it won't load. If it loads, it crashes. I have downloaded it on two different cells in the last days, with no luck. I have uninstalled, rebooted my cell, and reinstalled. Can't seem to get it to work. Also, it would be great to be able to access desks we've preciously purchased, when playing HeadsUp on Houseparty. Hope you fix the app soon. We really enjoy playing.",1
com.wb.headsup,Andrew MacLaine,"So fun! Even with only 2 people it's awesome, but more silly in a group! As for the ""crashing"" in the reviews, I realized *WHEN PLAYING, YOU MUST HOLD YOUR DEVICE BY THE SIDES ONLY!!* Accidentally touching your screen (easy to do because you're not looking) can send a command to go to your home screen! It has nothing to do with an app error.",5
com.wb.headsup,A Google user,"I had this on my previous phone, Samsung Galaxy 6, but in my new phone, Pixel 4, it crashes on opening. It literally will start to open and then immediately closes/crashes. It's one of our families favorite games. So bummed it's no longer working. I've purchased several add on decks and would love to get it working. Please fix the bugs.",1
com.wb.headsup,Sean M,"Fun game, but they're constantly making the user experience worse in favor of monetization. They removed ALL settings (including the adjustable timer) and menu navigation has gotten worse with each update. Half of the screen is taken up by offers for more purchases on screens where that used to be entirely gameplay. Decks no longer have descriptions available. No way to disable Live Replay without restricting app permissions. It's frustrating to see it get worse and worse.",2
com.wb.headsup,Pawe≈Ç Dziemianko,"Used to play this app a lot, even bought extra decks. For my work, however, I need to make customized decks and it‚Äôs a nightmare. First off, there‚Äôs just ONE you can make at a time. Adding new words is tough. The start screen is overloaded with rubbish nagging you to buy extra decks etc. Frustrating is the word that sums up my experience. BTW, try CHARADES, so far it has worked briliantly for me.",2
com.wb.headsup,5orsky Sorsky,"U.I isn't done very well. You have to scroll through over dozens if not hundreds of genres in order to find what you're looking for, granted that it keeps the ones you play in front but I would really like to see a favourites tab or even a search tab. The make your own deck is really a great addition but it's not working as fluid as I would like. It doesn't save the name of the deck and descriptions properly and it would be great if that also has its own tab and creation for easy edits.",3
com.wb.headsup,Oliver Winwood,"I purchased the Harry Potter add-on, this is on a Google Pixel 6 Pro with latest software. Upon selecting the add-on I am presented with a black screen and it failed to load, making it unplayable. I requested a refund however Google have said it isn't eligible. Frustrating to spend ¬£2.99 on content that I now can't use. Otherwise the game is pretty fun.",2
com.wb.headsup,ItzBella G,"Looks like a good game. Unfortunately, I have never got to play it. The game is really laggy and crashes on the home screen. I would probably rate higher if these issues were fixed.",1
com.wb.headsup,Michael Linberg,"I've bought 3 packs and everything was fine but then I bought the Harry Potter packs and they don't load at all no matter how long I wait. Restarted my phone and removed and downloaded the app again to see if that was the problem, but every other pack still worked besides the harry potter ones. I don't pay for things for them not to work...",1
com.wb.headsup,Graeme Cooper-Volkheimer (x Critical Strike x),"Love this game, but this app is awful on android compared to iPhone. The scrolling is side ways showing only 3 decks at a time and scrolls so slowly its a pain to find a deck. Some decks are missing like Star Trek? Needs improvement compared to the other OS. Update - it is still bad.",2
com.wb.headsup,Katharine,"This app is awesome when you're bored , you can play it with your friends and family I played it with my family ‚ù§Ô∏è but there is only one disadvantage, there is only a limited amount of options are available üôçüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü•≤",4
com.wb.headsup,Aaron Powers (thatmagicstore),Love the game. Love it. Makes for a great quick game or several of them over a night. Update: What did you do to the home screen. That is just awful and horrendous. Put it back,1
com.wb.headsup,Stephanie Ouimette,I bought the create your own deck but it's not doing anything. I click on it and it just says place on forehead and doesn't do anything. It doesn't give me a chance to customize anything or do anything. So I need to either be reimbursed or it needs to be fixed or tell me if there's something else I need to do.,1
com.wb.headsup,C Phelps,"First deck ""build your own"" can't find the build section. Can't find support to ask help game straight up works but overly restrictive and not intuitive interface prevents me doing what I want",2
com.wb.headsup,Adil,I've spent ¬£20 on the entire set but some of them don't even work??? The star wars and Harry Potter for example keep my phone blank and black and I have to restart my phone to use the app. I have a Samsung s22 so it can't be an update issue?,1
com.wb.headsup,A Gee,I dont even have enough money to pay. And when it was loading suddenly is frozed.i hate this game a lot .its one of the most crapest game in the world,1
com.wb.headsup,TERESA,You have to purchase anything/everything you want. I really wished I had read reviews BEFORE I purchased it because IF it makes it all the way to 1st item to guess it usually doesn't go any further and most the time it just sits there like it's trying to start then just kicks you completely out. Don't waste your time and money!!,1
com.wb.headsup,Andrew Courtney,Fun game! But the customize feature on build your own decks doesn't appear anywhere so I can actually build the deck,4
com.wb.headsup,Felicia Yoakum,"Great game, my family loves to play, but needs some TLC. For instance the seasonal packs only have a few cards, so after just 1 round with 4 people we already see repeats. Also, you really need a ""The Office"" deck.",4
com.wb.headsup,Ken Everett,"This app is worthless without the ""build your own deck"" add-in feature. One of Ellen's points about this game was that she used it to make meetings more interesting, or to use as an educational aid for children. Please advise when/if this will be available again.",2
com.wb.headsup,Travis Wantland,"I bought the Harry Potter Expansion pack and every time I try to use it the screen just goes black. Tried exiting app and re entering and Uninstaller and reinstall, still just black screen.",1
com.wb.headsup,Grayson DeWitt,"This is the worst user experience I've experienced for a simple game app. Just opening up the app is a roll of the dice, you never know if it'll actually open and if it does it takes 5 minutes for it to load. It requires internet connection just to open the app which is ridiculous for a simple party game app. You should be able to launch this while waiting in line for something and play a couple rounds, but its wildly inconsistent. Two stars because when the game actually works it is fun.",2
com.wb.headsup,Lydia Cain,"How do you make your own deck? It goes straight to playing the deck with option""1"" and won't even let us flip to say wrong or right.",1
com.wb.headsup,Patrick Bigler,Too many notifications. I don't need ads I'll play the game if I want to. Which I don't anymore.,1
com.wb.headsup,Cassie Wilson,"Trying to play after we just bought $15.00 CAD expansion pack and the app won't load 6 times in a row now after updating and restarting, on a Friday night when we're trying to play it, Pretty pissed off. Get better load balancing. This is stupid and I want my money back for a better app that I can play with my friends.",2

com.wb.headsup,Sonya Wright,Can't get game to start. Just a bunch of ads.,1
com.wb.headsup,A Google user,"It used to be good although I had to restart it after a while as the sounds would eventually stop working. With this latest update, the new whizzy graphics that have been introduced for each name makes it slow. It's hard to read as it swaps over so you lose at least a second between each one. I don't think it was very well thought through. Also, it plays the recording audio with a frozen video on the screen when you're trying to look at the answer you got right or missed which blocks them. There doesn't seem to be an option to turn this off.",3
com.wb.headsup,Ian Schatzle,Couldn't get past the ads to actually play the game.,1

com.wb.headsup,Jamie Milliken,"I'll change this rating if the crashing issue is fixed. It's been too long and too many people with the same issue that it feels 'ignored'. Like others, I try opening, it crashes. Reinstall, crashes. Clear cache, crashes. Pretty pointless to have this app take up space, and a little disappointing that I spent $ on packs I can't use. Family sitting together - ""hey, let's play that Heads Up! game""... ""Sure! Oh, no, wait, it's still broken"". Please fix!",1

com.wb.headsup,laylia doran,Settings are gone?????? You used to be able to extend the game timer. Because there were settings. Now there legit isn't even a settings option. I've spent over $45 on this game over the last 3 years. This is stupid.,2
com.wb.headsup,Michael Yang,Not a game. Just an ad platform. I downloaded the app and got a paywall that I can't exit out of. üóëÔ∏è Devs. This used to be a good game. Now it's just a trap to get you to pay for other games you probably don't even care about.,1
com.wb.headsup,Myisha Peterson,"This GAME/APP Sucks! Everytime I try to access this game, it never loads. I un- install and re- install only for the game to still not load. I have bought decks and can't even play the game. Not worth the time!",1

com.wb.headsup,Elsey Underdown,Great game. Super fun downloaded to play with friends. Lots of fun and super easy to use. Couple of reasons why I didn't give it 5/5. First it can sometimes be a bit glitchy for example it will get stuck on pass or correct for a while. Second you only get a few packs and they cost so much!!! If this could be improved it would easily be 5 stars.,4
com.wb.headsup,Rachael C,"This game automatically charged me twice today without my permission, once for ""Welcome Offer 2022"" for $21.99 and once for ""Fun With Marvel Friends"" for $10.59. I got a free version of this game ages ago, opened it once, and haven't used it. I only became aware of this through the charges to my account. There is no way to contact the game for a refund.

I hope the developers put some effort into it and fix the bugs, instead of just releasing new decks. Until then, it's useless.",3
com.wb.headsup,Regina DeDominicis,"Not very user friendly and certainly not customizable. One would think that if you pay $30 for a lot of fun that you'd be able to customize the amount of time you have to play. Furthermore, not being able to back out of one category after finishing a round to try something different is not possible. You're trapped and can't get out until you play several rounds UNLESS you quit the game and relaunch it. Horrible design, especially for the money!!!",1

Disappointed that I couldn't play such a fun game :(",1
com.wb.headsup,Joshua A,I liked the original version better. It was more customizable and had a point system that you could play and use the points for more decks.

com.wb.headsup,A Google user,"Game actually mostly works for me, despite other comments saying it crashes. Tilting sensitivity needs to be raised, because it doesnt register an up or down sometimes.

com.wb.headsup,A Google user,"This was my go-to car game, but ever since I upgraded to a new phone, I can't use it. It's pretty unacceptable that I've got a newer piece of tech that is suddenly ""incompatible"" with this app - especially as I've purchased decks in the past (you got my money and I have nothing to show for it, so I guess I learned my lesson about ever purchasing anything from WBIE). And of course, since it needs an active Internet connection, I can't even use my old phone unless it's connected to Wi-Fi (defeating the purpose of it being my ""in the car"" game).",1
com.wb.headsup,Chris Diesch,"Honestly the user interface is AWFUL. I have a z fold 3, and I don't expect every app to use the full inner screen, but even besides that it's still a UI reminiscent of the earliest days of app development. It lacks a search function for searching through the decks. It lacks the ability to adjust the timer or to randomize the decks, in fact as far as I can tell there are NO settings of any kind available. While the core game itself is fun. The UI is so awful it's not worth the hassle.",1
com.wb.headsup,Orlando Shelly,Fun and addictive game. Super annoying that there is no settings to turn off music but leave on sound for the countdowns or change the time allowed.

com.wb.headsup,A Google user,"I have had many a fun minute playing this game. However I can't give it a high rating because there simply aren't enough answers, so games become very repetitive very quickly. If you play 4-5 times in one category you will see the same answers coming up again and again. It takes all the fun out of it, because the person describing will just say ""that young actor we had in the last round"" etc. This isn't just the free games.

I only rated 4 stars because as others have mentioned, the decks do repeat themselves eventually.

com.wb.headsup,A Google user,Fun but frustrating. The game is fun. I always have a blast with playing with friends. I enjoy the the decks and have purchased a few. I will say the game doesnt always register the motion. Which shaves time off the clock and makes it very frustrating.,3
com.wb.headsup,A Google user,"Controls are unreliable, reading the up on a correct (making it register as a pass) and freezing. Sound shuts off after about 2 rounds and is often delayed, complicating gameplay. The decks are cool and fun. Has the potential to be a great app.",2

com.wb.headsup,A Google user,"We had many hours fun playing this with friends last night and we have bought also a couple of new decks. What I do not understand is why the video doesn't record anything, it's only a frozen screen with sounds - that would have been awesome if that would work cuz we had some hilarious moments we wish we could have watched back. Also we think there should have been one test play before buying a deck because the description is not always sufficient .",3

com.wb.headsup,A Google user,"The app was very unintuitive and slow. The loading screen when you first open the app has no loading indicator, so you don't know if it is actually loading or just frozen. The animations are clunky and choppy, and are unsatisfying to use.

com.wb.headsup,Sean Duffey,It feels very orientated towards the USA market audience on some decks would very much appreciate a UK version. Does the custom deck have a limit? I spent a long time creating and saving 250 cards but the play button didn't become active and I ended up losing all the data. A frustrating experience. Can I also suggest customisable game time so you can increase from a minute thanks,3

I was actively losing decks! clicked the REPORT ISSUE button at the bottom of the app and was taken to an email address. Sent a message stating the problem and that I wanted help getting the remaining decks. Later received a reply to please redirect all issues to a different email address. I send to the new email address and get a reply hours later that they received my email but ""since it's the holidays responses are slower"". I think nothing of it -it's the holidays right not much i can do. I don't hear back by Tuesday after Christmas and so I dispute it with Google, because now I want my money back. but digital downloads have to be requested within 48 hrs (not a thing I'm aware of at the time but ok). Other than that you have to reach out to the developer. The developer STILL hasn't responded and that was over 2 weeks ago - must've been one heckuva christmas party! Paypal wasn't much help either, though, to be fair, the agent couldn't reopen my claim but gave me a credit for 1/2 of it to be used on another paypal purchase. So save your money, or just actively flush it down the toilet if you want. It might be more entertaining with a lot less drama.

After relaying details of my device, they were quick to reply and (once the new version was available to me in Google Play) all went well. For users with legacy (old) devices like my own, try the v4.2.121 version!",5
com.wb.headsup,A Google user,I have tried to download this app several times and it has not been successful. I've tried and I've tried apparently there's a glitch in the system or something because I can download it on my Android but I cannot download it on my tablet so my opinion it is useless and it's too bad because it's such a popular app.... Don't know what to say other than something should be fixed. Done trying it's useless,1
com.wb.headsup,A Google user,Played this game on a friends iphone and it was so much fun and worked great. But on my galaxy s10+ it says pass instead of correct and vice versa and also wont actually register the switches correctly. Really a bummer..,1
com.wb.headsup,Zainub,It's really fun and I like it. But the prices for decks is a bit unreasonable. And it would be great if users were able to adjust the time for rounds because 1 min is a bit short.,3
com.wb.headsup,A Google user,It's a fun game. I play it often. Would recommend. Just a little frustrating that the app isn't all that stable. Crashes regularly. Once again - fun game.,3
com.wb.headsup,A Google user,"This is probably my families favorites game to play together, lately however it has been very glitchy and will close mid game. We have stuck it out and kept playing, but since it updated just yesterday I was hopeful that they fixed these problems....but today the app won't even open üôÅüôÑ please fix! We want our game back!!",2

I love heads up and i am sure you will as well !!!!!!",5

Gonna delete this app and download the knock off version that has packs for free...",2

com.wb.headsup,Carlos R.,"I used to really enjoy this. I've Uninstalled and reinstalled this app ""as needed"" and it seems every time they charge for more and more decks. Not only that should I buy a pack it will not save and be usable should you Uninstall and reinstall down the road. Definitley the last time I download this app.",1
com.wb.headsup,A Google user,Wow! I give this a 5 star because it's truly amazing. I play this with my brother and it's funny because he always fails üòÇ Not in a bad way btw. Well i recommend this game at home cause the internet lol. But can you please add more themes to it? Its really anoyying. But the game is amazing!,5
com.wb.headsup,Jonathon Welsh,It woild be really nice it is loaded into it. I was working just a few days ago and not it is loads 75% and then stops. I have reinstall and restarted the device. After all the money buying extra packs,1
com.wb.headsup,Janet Brooks,They had like $289.00 crossed out for the price of the app which is BS. And then they still wanted twenty bucks do a guessing game well I'm sorry I'll buy the game from the store if I have to pay money for it so I can keep it not get charged again for the thing that is ridiculous,1

com.wb.headsup,riqui lugo,We were standing in line in a group at six flags trying to kill time while waiting for the rides and you know how long that takes! It's a fun game to kill time. After we started doing it we noticed other people copying us and downloading the app. So if you need a Time killer in a crowd this is it,5
com.wb.headsup,A Google user,"Great way to pass the time with a friend, at parties, or any group of people. Extra decks are very affordable, and something for everyone regardless of age or culture. I even use it at doctors office waiting rooms, everyone doesnt mind the waiting anymore lol",5
com.wb.headsup,Anne Fitzjarrell,"Its ok, it takes a while to load some times and I have to close it out and reopen it. Also I bought the build your on deck and it won't let me do images instead of words for my niece that can't read well yet. It also won't let me delete it says swipe but it won't delete.",2
com.wb.headsup,Atticus Zapur (Zapur),Change menu back. The old menu with multiple decks being visible is way better than this side scrolling small piece of garbage. I'll give it a better rating when it changes back. DON'T FIX WHAT AIN'T BROKE.,2
com.wb.headsup,A Google user,"Love the game and have almost every deck, but like others, the video is not recording on new S9+. The videos are a large portion of the fun with this app. Hope to see it fixed soon!",3

I want all of my money back, dont get this app unless you want things disappearing on you",1
com.wb.headsup,A Google user,"Game is really awesome ,im having very much fun with it....the reason I'm giving it 2 stars is that this game is not working properly on my device (Realme 3 ) ....I have to uninstall and again install it daily inorder to use it....this is very flustrating thing to do ....The app is not even starting after being used for a day..... Please help me out of this",2

com.wb.headsup,Jazmin Mofford,I used to have this game and it was so much fun. I deleted it a while back and just got it back but now it won't even load into game. I press play it takes forever and once the loading bar is full it kicks me out. My family and I are so disappointed we won't be able to play.,1
com.wb.headsup,A Google user,"Used to love this game but in a recent update they changed it so that a bunch of the decks that used to be free now have to be purchased, such as the kid deck. It's a fun game but I'm not spending a bunch of money to buy decks that used to be free.",1
com.wb.headsup,Lisa Gehrig,After 1 year I have not been able to play this game. It freezes and never loads. I have updated every time but still have not been able to play. I feel bad because I paid for extra decks I have never been able to play. I give up. Deleting app.,2
com.wb.headsup,A Google user,"Horrible game. The game doesn't even work with wifi, i had to turn it off to work, then it said ""create deck"" then there was no back button so i was stuck on that page, then it showed that it was 0.99 and all the packs. It wouldn't let me play. Very disappointed. Wouldn't recommend game at all.üòû",1
com.wb.headsup,A Google user,"I've always had an Android. When I first bought it, this game brought in many laughter for our traditional Thanksgiving game night. Now on my new S9+, it won't open. I've paid numerous times for new cards. Either I get reimbursed or you all fix the game.",1
com.wb.headsup,A Google user,"This is an excellent game and is family friendly. The only thing is you should be able to back out of a category without having to wait for the timer to run out.The categories should be update to 2019 and 2020 information(songs, artists, movies,etc.) Overall good game!!",5
com.wb.headsup,A Google user,At first it was slow and not always responsive in game but fun. Now it crashes instantly on my Pixel 4 XL. I've cleared cached data and uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Not happy.,1
com.wb.headsup,A Google user,Game is fun but the point is to be able to flip phone up to pass or down when you got it correct. That feature hardly ever works so we miss 3 out 5 at least most games.,3
com.wb.headsup,shannon house,My game will not start . In the last few months it clashed just about every time I start to play with my friends. Please fix what ever the problem is with this app. I love playing it with my friends and family. My rating will go back up once I'm able to play the game.,1
com.wb.headsup,Sylvie,"I downloaded this app because my friend and I played it on her phone and it was really fun. I decided to download the app myself but every single time I try to open it, it will go on the loading screen then crash. Really disappointed :(",1
com.wb.headsup,Natasha Bradley,This was a brilliant game to play with friends and family but now the app won't load. Have uninstalled and reinstalled but no joy. Sad really as it was a great game. Luckily I hadn't bought extra packs like some others so I'm not losing any money.,1
com.wb.headsup,A Google user,"Game works fine but video doesn't work which is disappointing as my phone is compatible . Also packs I am buying are not what you expect. For example TBBT barely has trivia questions of the show, it's impossible science questions mostly. So I wasted my money there. Now very hesitant about buying other packs eg Harry Potter and any others. Also please fix video as it is only sound and no video",3
com.wb.headsup,Lisa Velez,"Awful, i downloaded the game to try cause i seen it in an ad. I opened it up and clicled on ""play"" and as soon as it was done loading, it just exited out and i was back at my home screen on my phone.",1
com.wb.headsup,A Google user,It's really up to chance if it'll let me pass or mark cards as correct. Bugs out constantly. Really disappointing for a free app; there's no way I'd spend money on this.,1
com.wb.headsup,Dan Venable (BricknDan),"Game is fun, but I feel like I was douped on a in app purchase. The ad said 110+ decks for 19.99. For sure not 110, counted at 101 not including the free decks. Also, many are basically the same. Seemed like it wasn't what the ad said.",1
com.wb.headsup,A Google user,"The game is really fun and practical. We can have fun with our friends. But one thing that maybe can be adjusted is the Storage. It takes a lot of storage. If it comes to playing, it's fun and makes friendship bond stronger.",4
com.wb.headsup,A Google user,nice concept but app needs improvement. when you tilt phone down it stated that I passed and when I tilted it back it said it was correct. then we played again and tilt down was pass and correct was to tilt back. very confusing,2

com.wb.headsup,martha buadromo,It is a great app to enjoy with family and friends and does have a boost for people's energy. I give it 5 stars since its really fun but the only fault is that it has alot of decks that you can only play if you want to pay. But this game will definitely liven up your party.,5
com.wb.headsup,A Google user,The game is fun but whatever you do do NOT update i lost all of my decks and the suggestion they gave me was to update the game. Uhh if they read what i sent them they would know that is what caused this issue. I have now sent 2 reports for the issue and still no resolution. Guess customer service is not their area of expertise.,2
com.wb.headsup,Patrick Lucas,"It's fun, but they totally just advertised their entire collection (80+ decks at a supposed $186 value) for $40. Well, I only received about 60 of em and they still want to charge for decks that were supposed to be part of the deal.",3

com.wb.headsup,A Google user,the app was not working snd every time my friends and I tried to pass the question it stayed on pass for the whole time so we couldn notcontinue the rest of the game for the whole time we were doing it. This app needs to be fixed or else we will stop downloading apps from this company and we will never play this app ever again .,2
com.wb.headsup,A Google user,Was a fun game untill they converted all the free decks into pay decks. Now you have to buy all the decks that used to be free. Used to have over 10 free decks to play with and you could buy extras if you wanted more.,1
com.wb.headsup,Lisa Gendron,"Do NOT buy this game!!! I have lost a whole bunch of my purchased decks and can't seem to get ANY kind of satisfaction from this company.

com.wb.headsup,Rick Logsdon,"Had this game 5 years ago and loved it. Buy the free version and it gives you like 20 answers per deck. But when you buy it, it shoves in your face 600 options for purchasable decks along with a value from an original $105 Bundle! Predatory micro transactions to say the least and is scummy as hell.",1
com.wb.headsup,Sanele Ngema,"It's a great game. But very American. Unless you live for American pop culture, you will suck. At least there is a build your own deck option. But it's time consuming to build. Can we please have a South African version. Or south African decks",4

com.wb.headsup,A Google user,This legit takes sooo much time to load and when it does my home screen appears and when I go back to the game it starts loading up again....Such a hideous waste of time I do mo recommend it at all...Would give 0 stars if it was an option,1

com.wb.headsup,A Google user,I used to love this app but gutted that they are now charging for most decks & extortionate amounts too for what they are! Like others have said there is no way to log in so if your phone breaks doesn't seem like they transfer so I don't think I'll be using it again which is such a shame!,2
com.wb.headsup,Ed Bowman,This app doesn't work. Do not count on it to work when you need it. I even purchased games for it thinking they may work because they were paid games - NOPE. Had friends who wanted to play and it didn't work at all - we were looking forward to playing that night... You would be better off playing sharades....,1
com.wb.headsup,A Google user,It used to work just fine but now its glitching. I finally got it to download so when i clicked on the game it would take a long time to load but then exit out of the game completely. I really used to love this game and recently it just hasnt been working for me!,1
com.wb.headsup,A Google user,Stupid game takes forever to startup and when it does the decks also take forever to load. Everything has to be paid for. don't download this unless you don't mind paying for the subjects that are remotely interesting. Obviously a money grabbing game. One star because I can't give Zero.,1

com.wb.headsup,harrison voyles,I downloaded it on my other phone to play with some friends and it wouldn't load so I closed it out and tried to go back in to it and my phone started freezing and glitching and not working it would start opening random apps on the phone and the phone I downloaded it on is the s20 ultra so this phone has never done this before and the second I deleted it started working perfectly fine,1
com.wb.headsup,Sarah Chamberlain,"I agree with Kelsey. Tried to purchase all the decks for $19.99 and then the app froze while I was entering my Google Pay information. By the time it resumed, the offer had expired and I was charged $8.99 for only 5 decks !! Terrible.",2

com.wb.headsup,V Speaker,I was NEVER able to play this on my Android phone. Every time it loaded it went straight to advertising to purchase games. If the free one doesn't work why would I buy more? Worst app I've had since I began installing apps. UGHHHH!!!!,1
com.wb.headsup,Rabiya Rabiya,Are you frickin serious this game makes you go to home page after downloading it I have tried 4 times and it goes to home screen dont play this game its waste of time plus I used to play this but it was not 1 year ago it was fun at first but 2 days later it stopped working every time I open the app it turns black colour for god sake fix this bug,1

com.wb.headsup,A Google user,"this game is a waste, why let the game a fre download when its not going to play because it has a billing problem and cannot connect to google play that all other games immediately detect on andriod phones, this is really pathetic and shows that its nothing more than a scam. if games are to be paid for show that on google apps not after you've set it as a free download",1
com.wb.headsup,‚Ä¢Alice‚Ä¢,"I wasted my time downloading this it took 45 mins to download it, the reason why this game wasted my time its because i cant update it, when i try to play the game it says ""we got some exciting updates for you blah blah"" we only have one to choose ""Ok"" why cant we just cancel it just like the other games? When i click on ""Ok"" it literally sends me to playstore asking me to update it. When i update it, it will exactly update but when its installed, it says ""cannot update"". Please fix this. :^",1

com.wb.headsup,Marcus M,Game has updated to complete trash. Decks we bought aren't there now. Only a few free ones available. Far too many ads. It's so annoying that it's literally not worth playing.,1
com.wb.headsup,Garrett Bond,"While the majority of the packs are good, the one I was most excited for is terrible. The Batman pack is filled with misspelled words (carmine flacone, grapnel) and words that were clearly chosen by a bot or someone that knows nothing about Batman. Generic words like Dark, Icon, cartoon, CEO, and investigation",2
com.wb.headsup,A Google user,"Not user friendly. I cannot find settings located anywhere so I'm unable to extend the time. It's marketed as family friendly but kids are much slower than adults and get upset when they can only get 1-2 answers in a minute. With no option to extend the timer etc and then paying for content which is beyond even my years (the karaoke category has songs older than me and I'm 30 with nothing current!), my kids got turned off rather quickly because it seemed they were too young to play!",2
com.wb.headsup,runbcov,Many different categories to choose from including kid friendly ones. But I uninstalled it as soon as I found out it only gave you 45 seconds and no way to change it. I understand that that's how the game is played on the show but that's not enough time for my kids.,3
com.wb.headsup,A Google user,if I could give less than 1 star I would. I heard about this game several months ago and installed intending to play with my kids. today I was having some drinks with a friend and she wanted to play. we had a lot of fun for about 20 mins before my phone did the phone equivalent of the blue screen of death. this app caused my phone to spontaneously factory reset and none of my backups are working. I'm gonna have to spend hours resetting up my phone. thanks but no thanks üëéüëé,1
com.wb.headsup,Katrina Smith,"I own most, if not all, of the packs meaning I've spent $50+ on this game. It now has completely stopped working because it's poorly designed and can't load because it wants to load everything at once. Completely unusable in its current state.",1

It took my back to the app store and I don't know what to do. I don't know if it's just my phone or a bug on the app but something needs to be fixed. But otherwise this game is really fun and enjoyable!!,3
com.wb.headsup,Soul Fire,It's a good game but only one critic. Maybe add the ability to change the time of the rounds 1 min is really short when ur playing with a group of people,3
com.wb.headsup,Jonah Parker,Stop making try and buy your stupid decks. Used to be one of my favorite apps. Until it started trying to hard to sell its in app purchases. I found a free Cherades app that lets you customize and create any deck you like for free. I Uninstalled Heads up for free.,1
com.wb.headsup,A Google user,Okay so i just redownloaded the game and it wont open it keeps trying to load but the closes. Please fix this issue. I love this game when we have house parties or we need a great icebreaker for new people. Once fixed i will rerate this game. Thank you.,3
com.wb.headsup,Sierra Taylor,"The reason I gave it one star is because I was not able to access the game at all. Everytime I tried to play the game, it would start loading but then it would stop when it was almost finished. I am not connected to Wi-Fi but I have unlimited data on my phone. I really dont understand why this is happening, but I would like it to be fixed. Until then I am rating this one star.",1
com.wb.headsup,ANUSHKA DAYAL,Very few decks to play with. Only 4-5 decks to play without paying and it takes forever to open/load. It is interesting in the first few games but at one point it gets boring.,1

com.wb.headsup,A Google user,"The game itself is super fun. However I havent come across an app this greedy in quite some time. It charges $1 per DECK. Which is as asinine. And records and monitors your microphone even if youve denied permission. Then uses those sound bites to make the game extra personalized. Which would be fine if I gave permission, but I denied it.

com.wb.headsup,Ova Thinking,The app is bad the game is fun but then again we already like charades. This heads up version is lame that they charge for any of it. Turd controls and headbandz is a better physical version of what this wanted to be,2
com.wb.headsup,A Google user,App will not start. Gets to loading decks then crashes every time. Please fix this. I love the app but have not been able to start it on this device.,1
com.wb.headsup,A Google user,Worthless app. It slowed up my cell phone . I couldn't open the app. And I downloaded it twice. Very frustrating! I'm better off buying it at Walmart..,1

com.wb.headsup,A Google user,The app continues to freeze. I created my own game and I'm unable to play it. The phone freezes and I cant do anything. I spent .99 to be able to create my own and it doesnt do anything. Anyone know how to make it work. Frustrated,1
com.wb.headsup,A Google user,Been trying to load it for like 20 minutee be when it gets almost to the end of loading the screen goes bacl and it kicks me off the app. Hope you fix this soon!,1
com.wb.headsup,ronita satterfield,Crashes constantly!! Every time i go to play it it crashes or stops and goes back to the main screen.,2
com.wb.headsup,Gage Middleton,Great app but the only pack I got for free was the Brands pack and 90% of the cards were American companies- I'm in the UK. It would be better if you could select maybe 5 interests before it rolls so you have more chance of getting something relevant.,2
com.wb.headsup,A Google user,Once I got into the app and chose a deck it would get stuck saying PLACE ON FOREHEAD. It also took a while to load. I really wish it would have worked because Iv'e played it before and it was fun.,2
com.wb.headsup,Trinity Bair,"I had to uninstall this app to make some room in my phone, and when I reinstalled it on the same phone the 20 some decks that I PURCHASED are just gone. I either have to buy them again and waste another $20 or uninstall the app and forget about it. I chose the latter",1
com.wb.headsup,Madi,"Its an interesting game. But you only leave small games for the once that does not pay. The game should try to make events every month, a event game that is free from use instead of buying.",2
com.wb.headsup,A Google user,I've become irritated at the fact that it sometimes takes so long to go to the next card that I legit can't play no more. Fix that damn bug and then maybe I'll give a five stars review.,3

com.wb.headsup,A Google user,"This app is garbage now. You used to get a decent amount of decks for free that would rotate semi-regularly, but not you get four lame decks and everything else costs money. Rather than ruining a good thing, just develop another app to make money on, or learn how to get ad revenue. 2 stars.",5
com.wb.headsup,Edgar Luna,The game hardly ever loads. I constantly get stuck on the loading screen and haven't been able to play more than twice. Ridiculous,1

com.wb.headsup,Jessica Calderon,Wouldn't open and continued to crash. Literally never even got the chance to play the game because it wouldn't open. I tried it 10 times and nothing. I wish i would have listened to the reviews and not have wasted my time with this app. Seriously people! Don't even waste your time.,1
com.wb.headsup,Dennise Pendergrass,As soon as I bought decks I can no longer get the game to load. The load bar/circle fills but never moves from there. I've made sure I'm fully updated and have restarted my phone multiple times.,1
com.wb.headsup,Emily Fleetwood,It's a very fun game it has different titles and it even has Christmas as an option which were all excited about we never have trouble with the app it's a great app you should get it and my rating is posted and I hope this is helpful to you,5

com.wb.headsup,A Google user,"Fun game, but right now it crashes a few seconds after opening. I'd give it a 5 when the bug is fixed",1
com.wb.headsup,A Google user,I really enjoy this game but the only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because I paid for decks and now that I've changed phones and reinstalled the app the decks I paid for are no longer on the app and if I want them I have to pay for them again which I think is totally unfair. Please can you resolve this as soon as possible. I will not pay again for something I've already paid for,3

com.wb.headsup,Ursula Karon,This game attracts people to it. I've had so many fun times that got started with two people and have turned into twenty. I wish there was a way to change the amount of time allowed but other than that it's a fantastic time.,5
com.wb.headsup,Kara Fisher,"Fun concept. Tried playing it for days and it never once accepted an answer I gave, I'd be yelling the answer and it doesn't hear me... Whyyy?

com.wb.headsup,A Google user,i wish i could rate this 0 stars because it doesnt let you adjust the time limit and you have to pay for 3/4 of each games. what's the point of making an app like this free if you have to pay to play it.,1
com.wb.headsup,Jack C,"Pros: -A fun family game with many (paid) catagories Cons: -All catagories must be bought for real money at rip-off prices -Long loading times -Zero accessibility setting -Unable to change time for each turn -Everything is paid -If you choose to buy, the shop user interface is terrible. It's not clear what you are buying -Others report game breaking bugs that delete purchases, so be wary about sinking money into the game -Poorly optimised for Android Conclusion: There's better free alternatives",1

com.wb.headsup,Cat T,I don't know what the hell this was. It opened up to all these decks of cards that you could purchase... however I found one game which I couldn't figure out how to freaking play. It did nothing but count down showing some words but touching the screen or sliding it... nothing worked I don't understand what the hell just happened!!! What kind of game is this???,1

com.wb.headsup,Elizah Carrillo,This is a very fun game its just most of the things/ packs is that you have to pay real money and sometimes I get tired of playing the same pack over and over although i do have to say this is great to trick your family and spnd time with them.,3

Then 30 minutes And I literally took a 1 hour nap No kidding !!! What the HECK I HONESTLY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME.",1
