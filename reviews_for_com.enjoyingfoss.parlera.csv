com.enjoyingfoss.parlera,Alex Davies,"Just like the popular Heads Up game but it's Free, No Adverts, Open Source and the best part of all... it's highly customisable! It's easy to add more answers and also to create your own categories, we even used it to play Charades! The app works perfectly and it's easy to use. Congratulations to the development team, you've done a fantastic job on this ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",5
com.enjoyingfoss.parlera,Nick Kenrick,"Can't complain. It's got more decks than the regular heads up app with fewer ads, and it's free. I don't think there are additional decks to purchase, but if you're cheap like me you're good to go.",5
com.enjoyingfoss.parlera,Xarifa Cooper,Brilliant open source game that's easy to modify. Amazing!,5
com.enjoyingfoss.parlera,Vonnie Fielder,"Super fun game similar to Heads Up, but without having to pay for more categories and sit through ads. I just wish you could do unlimited number of words per round.",5
